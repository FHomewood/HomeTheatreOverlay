# Home Theatre Overlay

HTO is a simple winform overlay system designed to be a good interface for using windows with a controller, (specifically the steam controller which already has track pad elements in it).

It's a panel based modular winform designed to be customisable and useful to many users, it was concieved as an attempt to ease the use of a pc in a couch environment when a keyboard and mouse would be more cumbersome than useful.

## Aims
This software is produced by me, an individual developer, for the purposes of self improvement. Below is a list of aims that I hope this project will help me achieve:

* Provide a small quick to finish project where I can try to polish to a professional standard
* Learn more about Winforms and WPF
* Recognise and allow for user to user customisation instead of hard coding most options.
